the dragon rock 
 
this story begins with once upon a time  because the best stories do  of course  
     
so  once upon a time  and imagine if you can  a steep sided valley cluttered with giant  spiky green pine trees and thick  green grass that reaches to the top of your socks so that when you run  you have to bring your knees up high  like running through water  wildflowers spread their sweet heady perfume along the gentle breezes and bees hum musically to themselves as they cheerily collect flower pollen  
     
people are very happy here and they work hard  keeping their houses spick and span and their children s faces clean  
     
this particular summer had been very hot and dry  making the lean farm dogs sleepy and still  farmers whistled lazily to themselves and would stand and stare into the distance  trying to remember what it was that they were supposed to be doing  by two o clock in the afternoon  the town would be in a haze of slumber  with grandmas nodding off over their knitting and farmers snoozing in the haystacks  it was very  very hot  
     
no matter how hot the day  however  the children would always play in the gentle  rolling meadows  with wide brimmed hats and skin slippery with sun block  they chittered and chattered like sparrows  as they frolicked in their favourite spot  
     
now  their favourite spot is very important to this story because in this particular spot is a large  long  scaly rock that looks amazingly similar to a sleeping dragon  
     the children knew it was a dragon  
     the grown ups knew it was a dragon  
     the dogs and cats and birds knew it was a dragon  
     but nobody was scared because it never  ever moved  
     
the boys and girls would clamber all over it  poking sticks at it and hanging wet gumboots on its ears but it didn t mind in the least  the men folk would sometimes chop firewood on its zigzagged tail because it was just the right height and the ladies weaving group often spun sheep fleece on its spikes  
 
 
often on a cool night  when the stars were twinkling brightly in a velvet sky and the children peacefully asleep  the grown ups would settle for the evening with a mug of steaming cocoa in a soft cushioned armchair  then the stories about how the dragon got there began  nobody knew for sure  there were many different versions depending on which family told the tale  but one thing that everybody agreed on  was this  
     
     in times of trouble 
     the dragon will wake 
     and free the village 
     by making a lake 
     
this little poem was etched into everybody s minds and sometimes appeared on tea towels and grandma s embroidery  
     
the days went by slowly  quietly and most importantly  without any rain  there had been no rain in the valley for as long as the children could remember  the wells were starting to bring up muddy brown water and clothes had to be washed in yesterday s dishwater  the lawns had faded to a crisp biscuit colour and the flowers drooped their beautiful heads  even the trees seemed to hang their branches like weary arms  the valley turned browner and drier and thirstier  every hot  baking day  
     
the townsfolk grew worried and would murmur to each other when passing with much shaking of heads and tut tuts  they would look upwards searching for rain clouds in the blue  clear sky  but none ever came  
     
 the tale of the dragon cannot be true   said old mrs greywhistle  the shopkeeper  
      it hasn t moved an inch  i swear   replied her customer  tapping an angry foot  
     
it was now too hot for the children to play out in the direct sun and they would gather under the shade of the trees  digging holes in the dust and snapping brittle twigs  
      the dragon will help us soon   said one child  
      he must do something   agreed another  
      i m sure he will   
     they all nodded in agreement  
     
 
a week went by with no change  the people struggling along as best they could  some were getting cross at the dragon and would cast angry  sideways looks at it when passing  the villagers were becoming skinny eyed and sullen  
     
meanwhile  the children had a plan  
     quickly and quietly  they moved invisibly around town  picking and plucking at the fading flowers  with outstretched arms and bouquets up to their chins  they rustled over to where the giant rock lay  as still as ever  
     
the boys and girls placed bunches of flowers around the dragon in a big circle  they scattered petals around its head and over its nose  then danced around and around it  skipping and chanting the rhyme that they all knew so well  
     
     in times of trouble 
     the dragon will wake 
     and save the village 
     by making a lake  
     
the searing heat made them dizzy and fuzzy and finally they all fell in a sprawling heap at the bottom of the mound  they looked up at the rock  
     nothing happened  
     
a dry wind lazily picked up some flower heads and swirled them around  the air was thick with pollen and perfume  a stony grey nostril twitched  
      i saw something   cried the youngest boy  
     they stared intently  
     an ear swiveled like a periscope  
     the ground began to rumble  
      look out  run run   
     
the children scampered in all directions  shrieking and squealing  arms pumping with excitement  
     the rumbling grew and grew  
     the dragon raised its sleepy head  it got onto its front feet and sat like a dog  it stood up and stretched  arching its long scaly back like a sleek tabby cat  it blinked and looked around with big kind  long lashed eyes  
     and then its nostrils twitched and quivered again  
     the older folk were alerted by the screams and shrieks  the ladies held up their long skirts to run and the men rolled their sleeves up and soon the whole town stood together in a tight huddle at the foot of the hill  staring up at the large beast with mouths held open  
 
     ahhhhh aahhhhhhhhh    
     the noise erupted from the dragon  
      ahhhhh aahhhhhhhhhhhhh    
     the families gripped each other tighter and shut their eyes  
      ahhhhh chooooooooo    
     the sneeze blasted from the dragon like a rocket  throwing it back fifty paces  causing a whirlwind of dust and dirt  
      ahhhhh chooooooooooooo    
     
the second blast split open the dry earth  sending explosions of soil and tree roots high into the sky like missiles  and something else too     
     
the people heard the sound but couldn t recognize it at first for it had been such a long time since their ears had heard such tinkling melody  as their eyes widened in wonder  their smiles turned into grins and then yahoos and hoorahs  
     
water  cold  clear spring water  oozed  then trickled  then roared out of the hole  down the hillside and along the valley floor  
     
the torrent knocked over a farmer s haystack  but he didn t care  
     the river carried away the schoolteacher s bike shed but she cared not a jot  it even demolished the ladies bowling club changing rooms but they howled with laughter and slapped their thighs  when the flood sent pools of water out towards the golf course  filling up sixteen of the nineteen holes  the men just hooted and whistled and threw their caps up in the air  
     what used to be a dirty  brown dust bowl  now gleamed and glistened in the sunlight  sending playful waves and ripples across the lake and inviting all to share  
     
 hmmmmm   sighed the dragon sleepily  and showing his perfect movie star teeth   seeing as i m awake      
     and he lumbered forward with surprising grace and style and disappeared into the cool dark water with a small wave of a claw and flick of his tail  
     
they never saw him again  
     
after the families had restored and rebuilt the village  and set up sailing clubs for the children  and scuba diving for the grandparents  they erected a bandstand and monument in the spot where the dragon used to lay  every year to mark the occasion  they would bring garlands of flowers and herbs and arrange them in a big circle  the children would have the day off school  for it was known as  water dragon day  and wearing the dragon masks that they had been working on all week  would skip and clap and sing  
 
    the dragon helped us 
     as we said he would do 
     hooray for the dragon 
     achoo  achoo  achoooo  
    
and that is the end of the story
